Hey there! I’m Federico, a former software engineer on an exciting journey into the world of DevOps. My current focus is on building scalable, automated infrastructure and enhancing workflows using modern tools and practices. While I’m just starting in this field, I’m already diving into Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code—and I document it all in my home lab.

My home lab is more than a project; it’s where theory meets practice. It’s my personal playground where I experiment with deploying containerized applications, managing clusters, automating workflows, and exploring monitoring tools. Through hands-on learning, I’m tackling real-world scenarios to build a strong foundation in DevOps principles.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I’m an active member of the DevOps community, participating in discussions and collaborating with others to grow and share knowledge. I’m also passionate about coffee—it fuels my creativity—and hiking, which helps me recharge and stay balanced. When I’m not working on my home lab or learning something new, I volunteer for wildfire suppression efforts, where teamwork and quick problem-solving are critical.

This website is my space to document my journey, share my experiences, and showcase the progress I’ve made in DevOps. Whether you’re following a similar path or just curious about what I’m up to, I’d love for you to connect and explore alongside me.
