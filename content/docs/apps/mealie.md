## Description

Mealie is a self-hosted meal manager where I can collect, write,
and organize recipes—and even share them if I’m feeling generous.

## Why

I’m someone who enjoys staying fit and cooking my own meals,
so naturally I like having full control over what goes on my plate.
Mealie helps me do that with way less hassle. It comes with an HTML parser
that lets me scrape recipes directly from the web and break them down into clean,
structured data—ingredients, nutritional values, macros, all neatly organized.

But the best part? Mealie has APIs I can tinker with, which means I can connect
it to my biometric devices (like my Oura Ring) and start tying what I eat to how
I feel and recover. It’s not just about eating well—it’s about closing the loop
between food, performance, and data.
