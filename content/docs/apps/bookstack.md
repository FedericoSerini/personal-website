## Description

BookStack is a simple, self-hosted app that works like a personal wiki.
Think of it as a digital notebook with structure—perfect for organizing
knowledge without the chaos.

## Why

I’ve always been the kind of person who takes a lot of notes—not just quick scribbles,
but detailed, structured ones. Whether it's commands I always forget,
architecture diagrams, or half-baked ideas I want to revisit later,
I like having it all in one clean, searchable place.

BookStack fits right into that habit. It gives me just enough
structure (books > chapters > pages) to keep things tidy,
without being overcomplicated. It's basically my second brain
and the backend doesn’t complain when I throw YAML at it.
