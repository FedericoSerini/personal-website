## Description

Linkding is a self-hosted bookmark manager that helps me keep track
of the never-ending stream of interesting links I come across—articles,
tools, docs, you name it.

## Why

At some point, I realized I was collecting way too many links—spread
across browsers, notes, and chats—and finding any of them again was pure luck.
I needed something simple, fast, and searchable.

That’s where Linkding came in. Now I can tag everything, search by topic,
and actually find what I’m looking for without digging through a browser
history black hole. It’s lightweight, clean, and does exactly what
I need: keeps my digital clutter in check.
