title: Homelab
next: /docs/hardware

The idea of building a homelab comes from a few key goals:

* Have fun!
* Practice Kubernetes and DevOps principles
* Share and showcase my work without exposing sensitive data. This forces me to think about security and treat the homelab like a real production environment, considering aspects like scalability and backups.

In the following pages, youâ€™ll find details on how the homelab is built and maintained, along with some personal insights.

This entire project follows [GitOps principles](https://www.federicoserinidev.com/blog/gitops_intro/), with FluxCD serving as the core controller.
