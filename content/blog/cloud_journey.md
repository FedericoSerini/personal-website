title: My Cloud Roadmap

I want to share some thoughts on my DevOps journey,
which all begins with a buzzword: Cloud. Over the years,
the cloud has become increasingly important in the software engineering
and DevOps landscape.

To deepen my understanding of this technology, I’ve decided to focus on AWS
as my primary cloud provider and pursue certification in it.
To prepare, I purchased a course on KodeKloud to help me get ready
for these certifications:

AWS Cloud Practitioner → AWS Solutions Architect → AWS Developer

Eventually, I also plan to earn the AWS DevOps Professional certification.

## Why I Chose AWS

I won’t lie—the biggest factor is market share. AWS dominates the cloud space,
making it a valuable skill to have. Additionally, I already have some hands-on
experience with AWS services like EC2 and DynamoDB, which I use almost daily at work.
