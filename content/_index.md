Hi, Iâ€™m Federico ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a software engineer exploring the exciting world of DevOps, where Iâ€™m learning to automate, scale, and streamline workflows. Through hands-on projects in my home lab and daily experiments with Kubernetes and CI/CD pipelines, Iâ€™m building the skills to solve real-world challenges.

Fueled by coffee and inspired by nature, I balance my tech pursuits with hiking adventures and volunteering for wildfire suppression efforts. This site is my digital journalâ€”where I share my progress, insights, and experiments.

Letâ€™s connect and build something amazing together!

This website is powered by Hugo with Hextra theme and hosted on Vercel
